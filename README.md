DREAM PH(R)ASES is a is a contemplative web-based experience designed to trigger "thoughts from nowhere."
Built with a Dreamcore/Liminal Space aesthetic, it presents the user with a series of surreal, existential, and mildly unsettling questions about their own body, memory, and surroundings.
It is less of a game and more of a digital meditation on the uncanny nature of everyday life.

The project explores the feeling of a "thought that pops into your head while you are distracted."
By focusing on simple, ignored details—like the position of your tongue or the darkest corner of your room—the game forces a brief moment of "de-familiarization" with reality.
Enjoy playing
